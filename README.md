Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a crucial role in the industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages like C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases that flow like a waterfall and bestv suited for well-defined requirements while agile is an iterative and incremental approach that prioritizes flexiblity,collaboration and responding to change.It is best suited for projects whose requirements are dynamic.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Provide a comprehensive tool for writing, debugging and testing code like visual studio while VCS tracks changes to source codeand coordinating work among team members an example being git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines- you can overcome by prioritizing tasks
Changing requirements- you can overcome by using agile methodologies that give flexibility

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the crafting of questions and statements to get the best possibke responses from AI models. It is important soa as to get accurate and clear results form AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is the weather today? improved: What is the weather today at Nairobi, Kenya at 12.05pm?
Adds Location – The vague prompt lacks a specific location, making it unclear which region's weather is needed. The improved version specifies Nairobi, Kenya.
Adds Time – The vague prompt does not indicate when the weather is needed (morning, afternoon, or evening). The improved version specifies 12:05 PM.
More Actionable – A clear and specific prompt allows for an accurate and relevant response, reducing confusion and unnecessary back-and-forth.
